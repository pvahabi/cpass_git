# Cpass Web

This is the official Cpass web platform repository.

## Installation

1. Install Truffle globally.

   ```javascript
   npm install -g truffle
   ```

2. Ensure truffle.js exported JSON has this object

   ```javascript
   networks: {
       development: {
           host: "localhost",
           port: 8545,
           network_id: "*" // Match any network id
       }
   }
   ```

3. Run the Ethereum development console.

   ```javascript
   testrpc;
   ```

4. Compile and migrate the smart contracts.

   ```javascript
   truffle compile
   truffle migrate
   ```

5. Run the webpack server for front-end hot reloading (outside the development
   console). Smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated.

   ```javascript
   // Serves the front-end on http://localhost:3000
   npm run start
   ```

6. Truffle can run tests written in Solidity or JavaScript against your smart
   contracts. Note the command varies slightly if you're in or outside of the
   development console.

   ```javascript
   truffle test
   ```

7. Jest is included for testing React components. Compile your contracts before
   running Jest, or you may receive some file not found errors.

   ```javascript
   // Run Jest outside of the development console for front-end component tests.
   npm run test
   ```

8. To build the application for production, use the build command. A production
   build will be in the build_webpack folder.
   ```javascript
   npm run build
   ```

## Login Flow

The overall flow goes something like this:

* The log in form dispatches an action creator which triggers a POST to the
  server
* The server validates login credentials and returns a valid JWT or 401
  Unauthorized response as needed
* The original action creator parses the server response and dispatches success
  or failure actions accordingly
* Success actions trigger an update of the auth state, passing along the token
  and any decoded data from the JWT payload
* A higher-order authentication component receives the new auth state as props
* If authentication was successful, the higher-order component renders its child
  component and passes the auth props down to it
* Before mounting, the child fetches data from the server using the token it
  received from its parent wrapper

## FAQ

* **How do I use this with the EthereumJS TestRPC?**

  It's as easy as modifying the config file!
  [Check out our documentation on adding network configurations](http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration#networks).
  Depending on the port you're using, you'll also need to update line 34 of
  `src/util/web3/getWeb3.js`.

* **Why is there both a truffle.js file and a truffle-config.js file?**

  `truffle-config.js` is a copy of `truffle.js` for compatibility with Windows
  development environments. Feel free to it if it's irrelevant to your platform.
